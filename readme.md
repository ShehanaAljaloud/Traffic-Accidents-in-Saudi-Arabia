<h1> Driving Licenses, Traffic Accidents and Casualties Analysis </h1>

<h3> About The Project </h3>
Analysis two databases, the first one is driving licenses from 1993 to 2017 and the second one is traffic accidents in 2016 and 2017 in Saudi Arabia. I will work on Python, statistics, EDA and visualizations, then I will mention the top cities in the number of driving licenses and traffic accidents and relationship between each other, finally I will mention some recommendations.



<h3> Datasets </h3>

- [Traffic Accidents and Casualties by Region](/data/saudi-arabia-traffic-accidents-and-casualties-injured-dead-2008.csv)
- [Driving Licenses Issued By Administrative Area](/data/saudi-arabia-driving-licenses-issued-in-the-kingdom-2004-2008.csv)

You can see the source for the accident data [here](https://datasource.kapsarc.org/explore/dataset/saudi-arabia-traffic-accidents-and-casualties-injured-dead-2008/), and the source for the license data [here](https://datasource.kapsarc.org/explore/dataset/saudi-arabia-traffic-accidents-and-casualties-injured-dead-2008/). 

A quick overview on two datasets'  features / variables / columns, alongside data types and descriptions
